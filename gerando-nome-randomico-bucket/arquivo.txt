Strings and Templates
String literals are the most complex kind of literal expression in Terraform, and also the most commonly used.

Terraform supports both a quoted syntax and a "heredoc" syntax for strings. Both of these syntaxes support template sequences for interpolating values and manipulating text.

Quoted Strings
A quoted string is a series of characters delimited by straight double-quote characters (").

"hello"
Copy
Escape Sequences
In quoted strings, the backslash character serves as an escape sequence, with the following characters selecting the escape behavior:

Sequence	Replacement
\n	Newline
\r	Carriage Return
\t	Tab
\"	Literal quote (without terminating the string)
\\	Literal backslash
\uNNNN	Unicode character from the basic multilingual plane (NNNN is four hex digits)
\UNNNNNNNN	Unicode character from supplementary planes (NNNNNNNN is eight hex
